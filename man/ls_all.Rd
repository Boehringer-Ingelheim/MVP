\usage{
ls_all()
}
\value{
a character vector with the name of all objects available.
}
\description{
This function returns a character vector of all objects available. Unlike
\code{\link[=ls]{ls()}} this function will loop through all environments from the current
environment to \code{.GlobalEnv}. This will also verify that the object
is indeed available from the current environment using the \code{\link[=exists]{exists()}}
function call.
